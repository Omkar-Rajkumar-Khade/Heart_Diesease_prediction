# Heart Disease Prediction Project

## Overview

This project is a part of the heart disease prediction using machine learning techniques. It aims to predict the presence of heart disease based on various medical attributes. The project utilizes the CatBoost classifier, along with other popular machine learning algorithms, for accurate predictions.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains various attributes related to patients' medical information. These attributes include age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol levels, fasting blood sugar, resting electrocardiogram results, maximum heart rate achieved, and more.

Attribute Information:
- Age
- Gender
- Chest Pain Type
- Resting Blood Pressure
- Cholesterol Levels
- Fasting Blood Sugar
- Resting Electrocardiogram Results
- Maximum Heart Rate Achieved
- Heart Disease (Target variable)

## Models

The project includes the implementation of three classifiers: CatBoost, XGBoost, and LightGBM. Each classifier is trained and evaluated using the same preprocessing steps.
